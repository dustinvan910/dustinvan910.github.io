<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hi, I’m Quoc Dung Van, but you can call me Dustin! I’m currently an international student at the University of Victoria. I specialize in blockchain, distributed system, and data analysis, with experience in projects like blockchain protocol, video streaming system and machine learning applications.

I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Ho Chi Minh University of Technology, Vietnam, in 2012. In 2015, I furthered my education with a Master's degree in Computer Science at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). Driven by a passion for continuous learning, I chose to specialize in Data Science, which brought me to the MADS program at University of Victoria (UVic), Canada currently.
