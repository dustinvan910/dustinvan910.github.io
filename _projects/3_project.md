## Email Phishing Detection Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on developing and comparing multiple machine learning models to detect phishing emails. The goal is to create an effective classification system that can automatically identify malicious emails and protect users from phishing attacks.

### Models Implemented

I developed and evaluated four different machine learning algorithms:

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Effective for high-dimensional text data with clear margin separation
- **Logistic Regression**: Linear classifier providing probabilistic outputs and interpretability
- **Naive Bayes**: Probabilistic classifier well-suited for text classification tasks
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble method combining multiple decision trees for robust predictions

### Project Overview

The detection system provides comprehensive email analysis through advanced machine learning techniques, combining multiple algorithms to achieve optimal phishing detection performance.

### Key Features

The detection system analyzes various aspects of emails:

- **Text Content Analysis**: Natural language processing of email body and subject lines
- **Header Information**: Examination of sender details, routing information, and metadata
- **URL Analysis**: Detection of suspicious links and domains
- **Feature Engineering**: Creation of relevant features for machine learning models

### Technical Implementation

The project involved extensive data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model optimization:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathered labeled dataset of legitimate and phishing emails
2. **Preprocessing**: Text cleaning, tokenization, and normalization
3. **Feature Engineering**: TF-IDF vectorization, n-gram analysis, and custom features
4. **Model Training**: Implementation and tuning of all four algorithms
5. **Evaluation**: Comprehensive performance analysis using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

### Results and Performance

All four models demonstrated strong performance in detecting phishing emails, with comprehensive evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores. The comparison revealed the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, providing valuable insights for email security applications.

### Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for model implementation
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical computing
- **NLTK/spaCy**: Natural language processing
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of different machine learning approaches in cybersecurity applications and provides insights into email-based threat detection systems.
